JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. 
it is a casesensitive and scripting.
 

#Key Features of JavaScript: 

1.Client-side scripting: Runs in the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). 

2.Event-driven: Reacts to user interactions like clicks, scrolls, input, etc. 

3.Dynamically typed: Variable types are determined at runtime. 

4.Object-oriented & functional: Supports both programming styles. 

5.Asynchronous programming: Uses promises, async/await, and callbacks for non-blocking operations. 

 
 

ðŸ”¹ What JavaScript Can Do: 

Update web page content without reloading the page (e.g., AJAX). 

Handle form validations. 

Create animations and effects. 

Build single-page applications (with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue). 

Communicate with APIs and servers. 

Run on the server-side using Node.js. & expressjs 

Create desktop applications with electron framework 

Create mobile apss with react native. 

 

3ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the standard specification that defines how the JavaScript programming language should work. In simple terms: 

ECMAScript is the blueprint; JavaScript is the implementation. 

 
 

Full Form: 

ECMA = European Computer Manufacturers Association 

 
 

Why ECMAScript? 

JavaScript was created quickly in the 1990s. To avoid fragmentation (different browsers implementing JavaScript differently), a standard was needed. ECMAScript was created to ensure consistency across all browsers and environments. 

Feature 

Description 

ðŸ›  Standard 

Defines core features like variables, loops, data types, functions, etc. 

ðŸ’» Implementations 

JavaScript (in browsers), Node.js, Deno, etc., all follow ECMAScript standards. 

ðŸ”„ Versions 

E.g., ES5, ES6 (2015), ES7 (2016), ..., ES2024 â€” new features are added yearly. 

ðŸš€ ES6+ 

Introduced major features like let/const, arrow functions, promises, classes, modules, etc. 
Js is implementation of ECMASCRIPT
Actionscript is also implementation of ECMASCRIPT
