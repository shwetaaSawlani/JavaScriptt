ES6 Modules allow us to split JavaScript code into reusable files, making it easier to manage and maintain.

ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:
export: Makes functions, objects, or variables available to other files.

import: Brings those exported items into another file.

ES6 Modules use .js files and run best with a module-aware environment like Node.js with type: "module" in package.json or modern browsers.


 If you're using Node.js, make sure package.json has:


{
  "type": "module"
}
